First project at 42 school, make the toolbox for theC langage

Description in the subject :

This project is your very first project as a student at 42. You will need to recode a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that you will use during your whole cursus.

What I thought of it:

A project that seems complex at first glance, but which is very instructive. Because the correction software is really uncompromising and that's necessary. You wouldn't want to start your development career with a plasticine screwdriver...
